Given the research paper: 'Well Googled is Half Done: Multimodal Forecasting of New Fashion Product Sales with Image-based Google Trends' as attached pdf. And the provided file tree composition of the directory containing the data and models discussed in the paper.

Elaborate on how a python dash dashboard should look like (layout) which plots it should contain and which callback for the following described goal. (provide a full repository structure and for each file a brief description before going into the specific detail of the dashboard content and functionalities)

Goal:
We are Intellistock a startup focused on Sales forecasting for SME clothing stores and soon we will do a pitch presentation for our potential angel investors. In order to provide a first minimum viable product without owning any potential customer data we would like to demonstrate our product (dash dashboard) using existing data from the research 'Well Googled is Half Done: Multimodal Forecasting of New Fashion Product Sales with Image-based Google Trends'.
Our dashboard should provide valuable insights specifically on the topic of optimizing restocking and improving brand image via targeted advertisement and trend forecasting.

For context attached is also our lean canvas startup model.
